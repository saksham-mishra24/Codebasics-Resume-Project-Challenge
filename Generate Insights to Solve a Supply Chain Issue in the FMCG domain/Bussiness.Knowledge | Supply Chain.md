### In the world of supply chain management, two essential concepts are - 

## Orders and Order lines. 

* When a customer places a unique request on a given date, it is considered an order.

* Within an order, the customer may request multiple items, which are known as order lines. 

* - For example, if a customer orders four notebooks and two pens from Amazon, the notebooks and pens would be considered separate order lines.

## Measuring Line Fill Rate 

* Line Fill Rate is a metric that determines how many lines were shipped out of the total lines ordered.

*  This metric does not consider the delivery time of the order.

## Volume Fill Rate or case fill rate

* For the supply planning team to understand the total quantity they are able to ship for a customer per order or for a given period of time.

* - Let's say Amazon is able to ship you 4 notebooks and 1 pen.

* - The line item pen is failed because you requested 2 nos. So Line Fill Rate for Amazon for your order is order lines fulfilled / lines ordered => 1/2 => 50 %.

- Volume Fill rate will be total quantity shipped / total quantity ordered => 5/6 => 83 %


## On Time delivery %,

* It determines whether an order is delivered as per the agreed time with the customer. 

* This metric is important to the warehouse and distribution team to ensure timely delivery. 

* - An order is On Time only when all the line items inside the order is delivered on time.

## In Full delivery % 

* It Measures whether an order is delivered accurately as per the requested quantity by the customer. This metric is crucial for the supply planning team.

* - An order is OTIF only when all the line items inside the order are delivered In Full and ON Time.

##  On Time In Full (OTIF) % metric 

* The ultimate metric that measures the reliability of an order from the customer's point of view.

* It Measures whether an order is delivered in full and on time as per the customer's order request.

* This metric is essential for all sub-functions in the supply chain team to ensure that customer demands are met accurately and on time.

* This is a hard metric which measures the reliability of an order from customer's point of view.
* - An order is OTIF only when all the line items inside the order are delivered In Full and ON Time.

Measuring these metrics is vital to ensure customer satisfaction, identify areas for improvement and take necessary actions to optimize the supply chain's performance.

As supply chain management becomes more complex, tracking these metrics becomes increasingly important to ensure that customer demands are met in a timely and accurate manner.
