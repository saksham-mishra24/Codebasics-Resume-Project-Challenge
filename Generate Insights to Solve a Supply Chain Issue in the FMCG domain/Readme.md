# ðŸ“š About Company 

AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India, currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodara. 

* They want to expand to other metros/Tier 1 cities in the next 2 years.

# :exploding_head:  Problem Statement

AtliQ Mart is facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service issues. 

It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. 

The management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the â€™On timeâ€™ and â€˜In Fullâ€™ delivery service level for all the customers on a daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

# :writing_hand: Tasks

* Create the metrics according to the metrics list.
* Create a dashboard according to the requirements provided by stakeholders in the business review meeting.
* Create relevant insights not provided in the metric list/stakeholder meeting.

# Metrics List

### The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure -

* On-time delivery (OT) %: A metric that measures the percentage of orders that were delivered on time.
* In-full delivery (IF) %: A metric that measures the percentage of orders that were delivered in full.
* On-time in full (OTIF) %: A metric that measures the percentage of orders that were delivered on time and in full.

# ðŸ“Š Dashboard Requirements

* A daily summary of each metric for all customers
* A trend analysis of each metric over the past week
* A breakdown of each metric by customer and location
* An alert system that notifies the team when any metric falls below the target service level set for each customer.


# Additional Insights:

* Identify the root cause of service issues by analyzing the data collected.
* Identify the best-performing customers and use their success as a benchmark for other customers to improve.
* Use predictive analytics to forecast demand and ensure the supply chain can meet future needs.
* By implementing these metrics and insights, AtliQ Mart can improve their delivery service and retain their key customers, ultimately helping them achieve their goal of expanding to other cities in the future.

### Let's Do it.
